Through this project, I learned how to integrate large language models like Groqâ€™s LLaMA3-70B using LangChain, and build an interactive real-time chatbot interface with Streamlit.
I understood the importance of managing state across user inputs using st.session_state to maintain chat history, and enhanced the UI with custom HTML and CSS for a better user experience.
I also gained practical knowledge about securely handling API keys using environment variables, preparing projects for deployment on Streamlit Cloud, and troubleshooting common API authentication errors.
Additionally, I learned how model parameters like temperature affect AI behavior, and improved my overall skills in debugging, deployment, and building production-ready AI applications.
